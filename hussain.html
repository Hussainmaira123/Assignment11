<p>Three major aspects characterize my existence; my social life, my intellect, and my spiritual doctrines, and my social life. The intellectual part of my life comprises my studies, my artistic creativity, extra-curricular activities, my intellectual capabilities, and basically my life pursuits. My social circle is quite exciting which makes my social life quite uplifting and vibrant. I am a social butterfly and a very outgoing person. I always make it a habit to meet new people and make friends with them. My faith and spiritual doctrines inform the different decisions I make in my life and consequently guide who I have become as a person today.

My name is Hussain.I hail from Islamabad.I am very hardworking and I am discipline person.I live with my loving parents and siblings.My dad is a physician and my mother is a housewife. They have always been present in my life.

No one can reach the stage in life where I stand at the moment, without the unwavering support of family and friends. In fact, everything I have achieved in my life is because of my parents and my siblings. As I have mentioned before, my father is a doctor and he is a very respectable part of our community. My mother looks after the home. They both love their roles very much and that is exactly what I have learned from my parents. That is, no matter what you do in life, do it with sincerity and dedication.

We are four brothers and sisters and I am the eldest. Being in that position of authority, I am the most responsible and in charge of looking after my brothers and sisters and taking care of them. Reading is my hobby and I spend most of my time reading novels and storybooks. Plus, I have a keen interest in classical architecture. Other than that, I also try to take part in games and sometimes I go out to play football with my friends. I have been the top scorer many times, in fact.

I don’t have much interest in playing online games. I value my time and rarely use my computer to indulge in games. Instead, I spend my time with my friends who help me prioritize my life in discipline. I love time management and I have learned it from my father. He is my true inspiration and it has been my ambition to serve my community just the way he does.

My parents have also taught me that time is a priceless commodity and I should try my best to not waste anyone’s time. Throughout my life, I have learned the importance of time and have developed a sound strategy, time management skills, and clear-cut goals.

My life has always been full of achievements and experiments. I have succeeded one too many times in life but I have failed a lot of times as well. My failures have taught me to get up and rise above my problems and try again. I continue to work hard for my own betterment and become the best version of myself. Even though no one can be described in just a few sentences, I have done my best to write something meaningful about myself and my life. And that is what my life is all about – a mixture of meaningful achievements and struggles.</p>
